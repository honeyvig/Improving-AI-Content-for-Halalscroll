# Improving-AI-Content-for-Halalscroll
My project is called Halalscroll, an app designed specifically for the Muslim community. Its purpose is to filter and blur content on social media feeds where women appear in images or videos, as well as to block music. This app is aimed at helping practicing Muslims enjoy a halal browsing experience on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and more.

We’ve already found an open-source project that aligns with our idea, but we want to improve it. Specifically, we’re looking for:

Optimization of the current AI model to enhance speed and accuracy in detecting faces and music.
Experience with tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, or similar frameworks.
Integration of the improved AI into our mobile app, which we’re building in Flutter.
This is a unique and impactful project that has the potential to benefit millions of Muslims worldwide. If this aligns with your expertise and interests, I’d love to set up a quick call to discuss the project and your potential involvement.
---------
To optimize your project Halalscroll and integrate AI for content filtering (detecting faces, blurring images, and blocking music), you can use tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and other relevant machine learning frameworks. Below is a Python code outline for implementing the required AI model improvements, as well as how you can integrate the model into your Flutter mobile app.
Key Tasks:

    Face Detection and Blurring: Use pre-trained models like OpenCV or TensorFlow to detect faces and blur them in images.
    Music Detection: You can use a library such as librosa or an audio classification model to detect and block music.
    Optimizing the Model: Optimize the AI model for faster inference.

Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

You’ll need to install libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and librosa. Use pip to install them:

pip install opencv-python tensorflow pytorch librosa numpy

Step 2: Face Detection and Blurring (Using OpenCV)

We can use OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade model to detect faces in images and then blur them.

import cv2
import numpy as np

def detect_and_blur_faces(image_path):
    # Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade face detection model
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

    # Load the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Detect faces in the image
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))

    # Blur the faces in the image
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        face_region = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        face_region = cv2.GaussianBlur(face_region, (99, 99), 30)  # Apply blur
        img[y:y+h, x:x+w] = face_region

    # Save or display the result
    cv2.imwrite('blurred_faces_output.jpg', img)
    cv2.imshow('Output Image', img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Example usage:
detect_and_blur_faces('input_image.jpg')

Step 3: Music Detection (Using librosa)

You can use librosa to analyze the audio content of a video and check for music. Here's a simple example to detect music based on pitch or rhythm patterns:

import librosa
import numpy as np

def detect_music_in_audio(audio_path):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path)

    # Compute the tempo and beat frames
    onset_env = librosa.onset.onset_strength(y=y, sr=sr)
    tempo, beats = librosa.beat.beat_track(onset_envelope=onset_env, sr=sr)

    # If a tempo is detected, it indicates the presence of music
    if tempo > 0:
        print(f"Music detected with a tempo of {tempo} BPM.")
        return True  # Music detected
    else:
        print("No music detected.")
        return False  # No music detected

# Example usage:
music_present = detect_music_in_audio('input_audio.mp3')

Step 4: TensorFlow or PyTorch for Face and Music Detection Optimization

To enhance the accuracy and speed of your AI model for both face and music detection, you can use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it with your dataset. Below is an example of using a pre-trained model with TensorFlow:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import MobileNetV2, preprocess_input, decode_predictions

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')

def predict_image(image_path):
    img = image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    x = image.img_to_array(img)
    x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
    x = preprocess_input(x)

    predictions = model.predict(x)
    decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]
    
    for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
        print(f"{i + 1}: {label} ({score:.2f})")
    
    return decoded_predictions

# Example usage:
predictions = predict_image('input_image.jpg')

Step 5: Integration with Mobile App (Flutter)

For integrating the AI-based face detection and music filtering into your Flutter app, you will need to expose your Python AI models as a REST API. This can be done using Flask or FastAPI.
Example of creating a simple REST API using Flask:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import cv2
import librosa

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/detect_faces', methods=['POST'])
def detect_faces():
    file = request.files['image']
    image = cv2.imread(file)
    # Perform face detection and blurring here
    result = detect_and_blur_faces(image)
    return jsonify({"message": "Faces detected and blurred", "status": "success"})

@app.route('/detect_music', methods=['POST'])
def detect_music():
    file = request.files['audio']
    result = detect_music_in_audio(file)
    return jsonify({"music_detected": result})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Integrating with Flutter:

Once the API is running, you can send HTTP requests from your Flutter app to interact with the backend for face detection or music detection. Below is an example of a Flutter HTTP request:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:typed_data';

class HalalscrollApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HalalscrollAppState createState() => _HalalscrollAppState();
}

class _HalalscrollAppState extends State<HalalscrollApp> {
  // Method to send image to Flask API
  Future<void> detectFaces(Uint8List imageData) async {
    var url = Uri.parse('http://<your-server-ip>:5000/detect_faces');
    var request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', url);

    // Send image as multipart data
    request.files.add(http.MultipartFile.fromBytes('image', imageData, filename: 'image.jpg'));

    var response = await request.send();

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      print('Face detection successful!');
    } else {
      print('Face detection failed.');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Halalscroll'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the detectFaces method with an image
            // Pass the image data (imageBytes) here
          },
          child: Text('Detect Faces'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(home: HalalscrollApp()));

Step 6: Optimize AI Model for Speed

For improving the speed of the AI model, you can consider:

    TensorFlow Lite: Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite for faster inference on mobile devices.
    Pruning/Quantization: Use TensorFlow’s or PyTorch’s pruning and quantization methods to make the model smaller and faster without compromising much accuracy.
    Edge Computing: Deploying the model on the mobile device itself instead of a server can enhance speed and privacy, but it depends on the model size.

Conclusion:

With this implementation, you will be able to:

    Detect faces and blur them for a "halal" browsing experience.
    Detect and block music using audio processing techniques.
    Optimize and deploy the AI model for real-time use in your Flutter mobile app.

To scale this solution, you can enhance the backend, optimize models further, and add more filtering features based on user feedback.
